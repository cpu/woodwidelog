An attempt at a journal slash dev log by [@cpu](https://twitter.com).

I like: Go, cryptography, mountain bikes, ACME, computer security, mushrooms,
Nix/NixOS, death|black metal, Linux, skateboards, DNS, snowboards, Wireguard,
living in the woods, MUDs, LPC, & other people's dev logs.

I've worked at: [Block]/[Square], [Let's Encrypt]/[ISRG], [Fastly], [Leviathan
Security Group], & the [Carleton Computer Security Lab]. I've contributed to
free software like [Boulder], [Nixpkgs], [ZLint], and [Streisand].

I've lived in: the greater Toronto area, Ottawa, San Francisco, Montreal, and
the Laurentides.
