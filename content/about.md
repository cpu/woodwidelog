An attempt at a journal slash dev log by [@cpu](https://twitter.com).

I like: Go, applied cryptography, Rust, mountain bikes, ACME, computer security,
mushrooms, Nix/NixOS, death|black metal, Linux, free software, skateboards, DNS,
emoji, snowboards, Wireguard, living in the woods, MUDs, LPC, & reading other
people’s dev logs.

I've worked at: [Block]/[Square], [Let's Encrypt]/[ISRG], [Fastly], [Leviathan
Security Group], & the [Carleton Computer Security Lab]. I helped make [ACME]
and I've contributed to free software like [Boulder], [Nixpkgs], [ZLint], and
[Streisand].

I've lived in: the greater Toronto area, Ottawa, San Francisco, Montreal, and
the Laurentides.
