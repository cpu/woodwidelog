An attempt at a journal slash dev log by [@cpu].

🛠️💕 I like: Rust, applied cryptography, Go, mountain bikes, ACME, computer security, mushrooms, Nix/NixOS, death|black metal, Linux, free software, skateboards, DNS, emoji, snowboards, Wireguard, living in the woods, MUDs, LPC, & reading other people’s dev logs.

🚧🏗️ I’ve worked at: [Block]/[Square], [Let’s Encrypt][LetsEncrypt]/[ISRG], [Fastly], [Leviathan Security Group], & the [Carleton Computer Security Lab][CCSL]. I helped make [ACME] and I’ve contributed to free software like [Rustls], [Boulder], [ZLint], and [Streisand].

🕰️🦀 Recently: I've been working 50% on the [Rustls] ecosystem, and 50% supporting a [FIPS 140-3 certification for Go std crypto][FIPS].

💼💸 Soon: I will be available for work in early 2025. Reach out[^1] if you're in the market to hire for contract or full-time positions.
