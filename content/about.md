An attempt at a journal slash dev. log by [@cpu](https://twitter.com).

I like: Go, Cryptography, mountain bikes, ACME, computer security, mushrooms,
Nix/NixOS, death|black metal, Linux, skateboards, DNS, snowboards, Wireguard,
living in the woods, MUDs, LPC, & other people's dev logs.

I've worked at: Block/Square, Let's Encrypt/ISRG, Fastly, Leviathan Security
Group, and more.

I've lived in: the greater Toronto area, Ottawa, San Francisco, Montreal, and
the Laurentides.
